The data set "Final Tidy Dataset.txt" is the result of collecting, working with and cleaning the raw data provided (see Readme.md). It is the text output of 180 observations of 86 variables (excluding Subject numbers and Activity labels). The variables in this data set, are calculated mean values per subject (volunteers) and activity, that derive from the mean and standard deviation values of features measured from an accelerometer and gyroscope as presented in an experimental data set (UCI HAR Dataset).

The activities were:
1.    Walking
2.      Walking upstairs
3.	Walking downstairs
4.	Sitting
5.	Standing
6.	Laying

Mean and standard deviation values:
